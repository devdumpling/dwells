	      <h4>The final for my Operating Systems class allowed us to turn in a zine relating to OS concepts. I turned in the following set of poems (and received a 100).</h4>
	      <p>Note: It's currently out of order as the PDF was in zine-printable form, hence any multi-page poem won't carry over as expected. I will fix this soon.</p>
