Wisp is a text-based adventure game inspired by a Dark Room and others. 

The core functionality of the game is built into the wisp.html.erb file, which is mostly javascript built off of
the phaser.js library for making lightweight games.

The plot of the game is stored in html files, currently located in the same directory as the js-core. Don't look at the plot
files if you don't want to be spoiled. Consider yourself warned.
